# plalist - A life Sprint Tool

### What is a life sprint?
As a developer, I have been working in various versions of the [Agile Methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) for about five years.  There are various pros and cons to the Agile system, but two key items stand out to me that are missing in my life: Trajectory and Retrospectives & Planning.

####Trajectory
I am a list maker. It just is reality. I usually have hand written to-do lists to start every day. Like a nerd, I even go as far as adding little square check boxes next to the items.  I have tried other to-do list programs that will work across a lot of devices, but the problem is, I tend to leave them in disarray because I have no 'skin' in the game so to speak. There is no point to finishing the lists outside of alerts I set.  What I needed was a burn down, trajectory style graph to look at and see how I am doing. If I give myself 5 tasks for a day and only get 3 done, then I got a 60% for the day.  This little change is a motivator because I can see how I am doing over time and adjust the load on my lists based on what I am getting done on a day to day basis.

####Retrospectives & Planning
Piggy-backing on this, I also find that I constantly overbook my day with tasks.  I think I can get more done than I really can. So there needs to be some sort of retrospective aspect where I look back at my lists and figure out why I failed. In order to do this, tasks need to have weight and be planned. I need to add some value to each task to give me an understanding of how much I can actually do in a day.

####Enter plalist
The result of this is that I decided to make my own to-do list app that includes these features.  In this project I am utilizing ReactJS, Firebase, Yarn and Sass for development. As the project gets fleshed out more, I will include dev specific comments.

##Getting Started
To get started, clone this project to your desktop. After cloning it, simply install yarn (if you have not already installed it):

```
    npm install -g yarn
```

After installing yarn, run:

```
    yarn
```

That should build all your dependencies. To start the project run:

```
    yarn start
```

You should see a window open in your default browser with the project. You are good to go!
